<br>
<p>I am a senior attending Andover Central Highschool. I have been a part of the CAPS program for about one semester. I enjoy activities like playing piano and guitar, working out, spending time with my friends and family, and doing anything that can make myself and the people around me grow. I am interested in the field of computer science and software engineering. While I am undecided on exactly what I will do after highschool, I plan to continue my education either through college or a certification
<p>
<p>Prior to joining CAPS, I had little to no experience in engineering of any sort. I have always been interested in engineering because I enjoy doing activities that require creativity.I also have a lot of family who are engineers of all sorts, my dad is a software engineer. This last year is when I decided that I would like to try out software engineering, so about half way through the semester, I started taking the first steps of learning code, HTML and CSS (that is what this page is made up of).</p>
